[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world's leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation.

In the Data Science Path Cumulative Project, we have partnered with the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/) and we were given two related tables that describe user engagmeent with Twitch video and Twitch chat on January 1st, 2015:
