[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world's leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation.

In the Data Science Path Cumulative Project, we have partnered with the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/) and we were given two related tables that describe user engagmeent with Twitch video and Twitch chat:

- [x] [`stream.csv`](stream.csv)  
- [x] [`chat.csv`](chat.csv)  

The `stream.csv` has the following fields:

Headers | Description |
--- | --- |
`time` | rental ID
`device_id` | building ID
`login` | price of rent ($)
`channel` | number of bedrooms
`country` | number of bathrooms
`player` | size (ft²)
`game` | subway station (min)
`stream_format` | floor number
`subscriber` | building age (year)

The `chat.csv` has the following fields:

Headers | Description |
--- | --- |
`time` | rental ID
`device_id` | building ID
`login` | price of rent ($)
`channel` | number of bedrooms
`country` | number of bathrooms
`player` | size (ft²)
`game` | subway station (min)
`stream_format` | floor number
`subscriber` | building age (year)
